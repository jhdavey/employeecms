## Installation
  
To install, pull down the files from the repo. Then run `npm install` in the directory you would like to work in. Next you will need to create your database in MySql. You can do this by opening Mysql in your CLI and running the command `SOURCE schema.sql`. This will create your employee database along with departments, roles, and employees tables. IF you would like to seed the database, run `SOURCE seeds.sql`.

## Usage
  
Once you have installed the app, right click on one of your files in the directory you're working in. Click "Open in Integrated Terminal". Then in your command line, type `npm start`. You will be prompted with the employee database menu.

Here you will see options to view departments, roles, and employees, add departments, roles, and employees, as well as update employee records.
